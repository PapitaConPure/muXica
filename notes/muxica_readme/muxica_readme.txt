In order to use muXica, some things need to be set up first. Let's go over those:

1. muXica uses audio groups to work. They can be named however you want
   Here's how to create them:
	a. In the top toolbar, click Tools
	b. Go to Audio Groups
	c. For each group, click on "Add New" and set their respective names

2. Every sound you want to play through muXica needs to be in one of these audio groups
   This can be done in two ways:
	* In the Audio Groups window, click the "Add Asset" button at the bottom and select the sounds you want for that group
	* Go to each sound individually and select their Audio Group at the bottom of the Sound window

3. You can check "Scripts » muXica » 0. Config" to link the audio groups you created to muXica.

4. You can also configure various muXica parameters and behaviors in said directory.




There's no official website for documentation because I'm poor and dumb in no particular order
