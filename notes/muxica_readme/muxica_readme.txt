In order to use muXica, some things need to be set up first. Let's go over those:

1. muXica uses exactly 2 audio groups to work. They must be named BGM and SFX.
   Here's how to create them:
	a. In the top toolbar, click Tools
	b. Go to Audio Groups
	c. For each group, click on "Add New" and set their respective names

2. Every sound you want to play through muXica needs to be in one of these two audio groups
   This can be done in two ways:
	* In the Audio Groups window, click the "Add Asset" button at the bottom and select the sounds you want for that group
	* Go to each sound individually and select their Audio Group at the bottom of the Sound window
	
3. You can check Scripts » muXica » 0. Config to change some parameters and behaviors of the muXica system




There's no official website for documentation because I'm poor and dumb in no particular order
