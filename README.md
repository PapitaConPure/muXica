> [!NOTE]
> This is a work in progress and will not always be in active development. I'm basically making this just for my game and making this repo public because that sounds fun

## Installation
I'll eventually share a .yymps here, I think

## Getting Started
I'll eventually explain this better than in that one txt

## Features
* Easier sound instance and audio group manipulation
* Easy crossfading from instance to asset, group to asset, etc
* Sound tags to categorize your sounds
* Programmatical audio cues and music time functions
* Synced or unsynced crossfades

## To Do
* More audio group flexibility other than obligatory BGM+SFX
* Support for GM audio emitters and effects
* Runtime effect knobs
* Maybe a Composition abstraction for when a certain music or sound effect is imported as multiple sound assets

> The stylized X symbolizes a crossfade effect, which is the very reason why I decided to start working on this.

> All the music and sound effects in the test project are made by me (Papita con Puré). If you'd like to, you can check my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PapitaPure?sub_confirmation=1)
